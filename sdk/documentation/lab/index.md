# Lab Environment

The lab environment enables the developer to run the DigitalState platform on a local machine as a dockerized application.

It also provides useful bulk commands to help during development.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** Git and Docker on your local machine.
2. **Download** the SDK repository.
3. **Boot** the SDK container.
4. **Generate** jwt keys for the system.
5. **Configure** the Ansible lab environment.
6. **Add** dns entries to your host file.
7. **Deploy** the dockerized application locally.
8. **Test** the application.

## Installation

1. To begin, you will need to install Git (for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_windows), for [Mac](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_mac), for [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_linux)) and Docker (for [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows), for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac), for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server)) on your local machine.

   > Note: Docker Toolbox for Windows and Mac is not compatible.

2. Open a command prompt and download the repository:

   ```
   > cd C:\Users\Demo
   > git clone https://github.com/DigitalState/Sdk.git
   > cd Sdk
   ```

3. Boot the SDK container:

   ```
   > docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Confirm the container has been booted successfully:

   ```
   > docker ps
   ```
   
   You should see the following output:
   
   ```
   CONTAINER ID     IMAGE       COMMAND       CREATED           STATUS           PORTS     NAMES
   4ceab8511b85     sdk_sdk     "/bin/sh"     3 seconds ago     Up 2 seconds               sdk
   ```

   At this point, you have the SDK container running on your local machine as a bare Linux Alpine system with Ansible pre-installed and ready to accept commands. 

## Configuration

Prior to deploying the dockerized application, a few actions are required by the developer:

4. Generate jwt keys for the system.

    > The DigitalState architecture uses [jwt](https://jwt.io/introduction/) tokens for user authentication. 
    > The authentication system requires a private and public key to generate and validate tokens. 
    > Jwt keys should be unique to each projects and are not included in this repository for security reasons. 

    Follow these instructions to create jwt keys ([for Windows](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen), [for Mac](#) or [for Linux](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/linux/puttygen)). Once created, copy the key files over to the jwt resource directory.
 
    The private key should be copied to `C:\Users\Demo\Sdk\resource\jwt\lab\key`.

    The public key should be copied to `C:\Users\Demo\Sdk\resource\jwt\lab\key.pub`. 

5. Configure the Ansible lab environment.

    > The lab environment uses the Ansible inventory file found [here](/sdk/ansible/env/lab/inventory.yml) for its configurations.

    The [encryption.secret](https://github.com/DigitalState/Sdk/blob/master/sdk/ansible/env/lab/inventory.yml#L13) config needs to be set to a random, unique and secret 32 character string.

    The [jwt.key_pass_phrase](https://github.com/DigitalState/Sdk/blob/master/sdk/ansible/env/lab/inventory.yml#L17) config needs to be set to the jwt key pass phrase defined at step #4.

    The [directory](https://github.com/DigitalState/Sdk/blob/master/sdk/ansible/env/lab/inventory.yml#L9) config needs to be set to the absolute path of the SDK app directory. The value will vary depending on your local machine's operating system:

    **Windows**

    Under Docker for Windows with Hyper-V, the value should be equal to the Hyper-V mounted directory path.

    For example, if you have put the SDK repository at `C:\Users\Demo\Sdk`, then the directory config value should be `/c/Users/Demo/Sdk/app`.

    **Mac**

    Under Docker for Mac, the value should simply be equal to the normal directory path, as long as you have shared the local `/Users` directory with the virtual machine.

    For example, if you have put the SDK repository at `/Users/demo/sdk`, then the directory config value should be `/Users/demo/sdk/app`.

    **Linux**

    Under operating systems that supports Docker natively, the value should simply be equal to the normal directory path.

    For example, if you have put the SDK repository at `/home/demo/sdk`, then the directory config value should be `/home/demo/sdk/app`.

6. Add dns entries to your host file.

    > The lab environment uses a local DNS under *.lab.ds.
    
    Locate the host file on your local machine.
    
    ### Windows
    
    Under Windows, the file is located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host`.
    
    ### Mac
    
    Under Mac, the file is located at `/etc/hosts`.
    
    ### Linux
    
    Under Linux, the file is located at `/etc/hosts`.
    
    Add the following entries:
    
    ```
    127.0.0.1 admin.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 portal.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.assets.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.authentication.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.camunda.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.cases.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.cms.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.formio.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.identities.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.services.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.records.lab.ds
    127.0.0.1 api.tasks.lab.ds
    ```

## Deployment

7. Enter the container console:
   
    ```
    > docker exec -it sdk /bin/sh
    ```

    Point to the lab environment directory:

    ```
    $ cd /etc/ansible/env/lab
    ```
    
    Execute the deploy Ansible command:

    ```
    ansible-playbook ./deploy.yml
    ```

    This command essentially downloads repositories, configures settings, builds Docker images, boots up containers, migrates databases and loads data fixtures for each microservices.

## Test

8. Now that the dockerized application is up and running, it is time to test it!

    > The DigitalState architecture is essentially a collection of microservices, all exposing various api endpoints to read, create, edit and delete certain data or achieve certain goals. 

    In order to test, we suggest using an api gui tool, such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). The SDK provides a pre-made Postman [collection file](../../../resource/postman/collection.json) mapping all microservices api endpoints and an [environment file](../../../resource/postman/env/lab.json) ready to be imported. Here are the instructions on how to import [collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections) and [environments](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments) in Postman.
    
    After importing the files, a new collection titled "DigitalState" will appear on the left and a new environment titled "DigitalState Lab" will appear in the dropdown top right.
    
    As a first test, we will **login** as a Staff user and **query** the list of users in the system.
    
    > The application comes with data fixtures that are loaded on first deploy as demo data. These data fixtures includes a few Business Units, Staff and Individual users, among other things.
    
    Under the "DigitalState" collection, navigate to `Authentication -> Login -> /tokens/staff`. Also, select the "DigitalState Lab" environment. Click the "Send" button. This action simulates a login by sending pre-configured user credentials to the authentication microservice and return a jwt token on success:
    
    ```
    {
        "token": "abc..."
    }
    ```
    
    Once a token is obtained, it can be used to access any other protected api endpoints that requires user authentication. Typically, you would need to copy this token to your clipboard and paste it in the next api query you wish to make in Postman. However, our Postman collection has been programmed to keep track of the last logged in user and use the current token on subsequent api requests automatically.
    
    Next, nagivate to `Authentication -> User -> /users`. Click the "Send" button. This action will send a GET request to users api endpoint and return a list of users:
    
    ```
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
    ```
