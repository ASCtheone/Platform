# Sdk

The SDK repository provides a starting point for local development.

It also contains a collection of scripts to help orchestrate the various parts of our architecture, both on your local machine and remote servers.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** requirements (Docker).
1. **Download** the SDK repository to your local machine.
1. **Boot** the SDK container and **enter** the console.
1. **Execute** console commands to help download repositories, boot microservice containers, create databases, etc.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com). The SDK makes use of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for its orchestration (which runs inside a Docker container on your local machine).

**Windows**
 
- Docker: [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)

**Mac**

- Docker: [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac)

> If your intentions are to eventually deploy on a remote server, you will also need to create a public and private SSH key prior to booting the SDK container.
> 
> The keys will be used by Ansible to establish SSH connections between the local SDK container and the remote server.
> 
> **Windows**
> 
> Create a public and private key using [Putty](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen).
> 
> **Mac**
> 
> Create a public and private key using the console and follow instructions:
> 
> ```
> ssh-keygen
> ```
> 
> Copy the keys inside the `config/ssh/` directory.

Boot the SDK container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After running the `up` command, you will be able to see the container running in the background by executing the following command:

```
docker ps
```

Enter the container in console mode:

```
docker-compose exec -it sdk_sdk_1 /bin/sh
```

> If you have created a public SSH key earlier, you will need to copy it over to your remote server as an authorized key in order to establish a trusted connection:
>
> Replace ip with the actual remote server ip.
>
> ```
> ssh-copy-id root@ip
> ```

At this point, we have the SDK container booted and ready to go.

## Documentation

The SDK contains various Ansible playbooks [here](resource/orchestration/index.md).
