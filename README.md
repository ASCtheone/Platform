The SDK provides a **set of tools** to help manage various parts of the DigitalState architecture, from setting up a local lab environment to deploying to remote servers.

It uses **Docker** and **Ansible** to help with orchestration and is the central repository used by developers.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** Docker.
2. **Download** the SDK repository to your local machine.
3. **Boot** the SDK container and **enter** the console.
4. **Execute** pre-built commands to help with various orchestration tasks.

## Installation

1. To begin, you will need to install Docker (for [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) / for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac)) on your local machine.

2. Download this repository.

3. Open a console and make it point to the root of the repository directory:

   ```
   cd /home/demo/sdk
   ```

4. Boot the SDK container:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Confirm the container has been booted successfully:

   ```
   docker ps
   ```
   
   You should see the following output:
   
   ```
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
   4ceab8511b85        sdk_sdk             "/bin/sh"           3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds                            sdk
   ```

6. Enter the container in console mode:

   ```
   docker exec -it sdk /bin/sh
   ```

At this point, you have the SDK container running locally with Ansible pre-installed and ready to accept commands. Next step would be to deploy a local [lab environment](sdk/documentation/lab/index.md).

## Documentation

The SDK contains various pre-built commands, implemented as Ansible playbooks [here](resource/documentation/operation/index.md), to help with development, testing and deployment.

Supported OS: **Alpine 3**, **Ubuntu 17.04**.
