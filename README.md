The SDK provides a **set of tools** to help manage the DigitalState platform, from setting up a local lab environment to deploying to remote servers.

It uses **Docker** and **Ansible** to help with orchestration and is the central repository used by developers.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** Git and Docker on your local machine.
2. **Clone** the SDK repository.
3. **Boot** the SDK container and **enter** the console.
4. **Execute** pre-built Ansible commands to help with various orchestration tasks.

## Installation

1. To begin, you will need to install Git (for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_windows), for [Mac](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_mac), for [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_linux)) and Docker (for [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows), for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac), for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server)) on your local machine.

2. Open a command prompt and clone the repository:

   ```
   > cd C:\Users\Demo
   > git clone https://github.com/DigitalState/Sdk.git
   > cd Sdk
   ```

3. Boot the SDK container:

   ```
   > docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Confirm the container has been booted successfully:

   ```
   > docker ps
   ```
   
   You should see the following output:
   
   ```
   CONTAINER ID     IMAGE       COMMAND       CREATED           STATUS           PORTS     NAMES
   4ceab8511b85     sdk_sdk     "/bin/sh"     3 seconds ago     Up 2 seconds               sdk
   ```

4. Enter the container console:

   ```
   > docker exec -it sdk /bin/sh
   ```

   At this point, you have the SDK container running on your local machine as a bare Linux Alpine system with Ansible pre-installed and ready to accept commands. 

   The next step would be to deploy a local [lab environment](sdk/documentation/lab/index.md).

## Documentation

The SDK documentation is grouped by deployment environments:

- [Lab](sdk/documentation/lab/index.md) - The lab environment deploys to your local machine and is used to further develop the platform.
- [Test](sdk/documentation/test/index.md) - The test environment deploys to a remote server and is used for continuous integration.
- [Development](sdk/documentation/dev/index.md) - The development environment deploys to a remote server and is used as sandbox.
- [Staging](sdk/documentation/stag/index.md) - The staging environment deploys to a remote server and is used as a pre-production mirror.
- [Production](sdk/documentation/prod/index.md) - The production environment deploys to a remote server and is used to serve the latest release.
