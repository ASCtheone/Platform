# Sdk

The SDK repository provides a starting point for local development.

It also contains a collection of scripts to help orchestrate the various parts of our architecture, both on your local machine and remote servers.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** requirements (Docker).
1. **Download** the SDK repository to your local machine.
1. **Boot** the SDK container and **enter** the console.
1. **Execute** console commands to help download repositories, boot microservice containers, create databases, etc.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to install Docker (for [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) and for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac)).

The SDK boots up a local docker container running [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for its orchestration.

Boot the SDK container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After running the `up` command, you will be able to see the container running in the background by executing the following command:

```
docker ps
```

Enter the container in console mode:

```
docker exec -it ds_sdk /bin/sh
```

At this point, we have the SDK container booted and ready to go.

## Documentation

The SDK contains various Ansible playbooks [here](resource/orchestration/index.md).
