The SDK provides a **set of tools** to help manage the DigitalState platform, from setting up a local environment for development to deploying to remote servers; from sandbox to production.

It uses **Docker** and **Ansible** to help with orchestration and is the central repository used by developers and devops.

- [Test](sdk/documentation/test/index.md) - The test environment is typically deployed to a remote server and is used for continuous integration.
- [Development](sdk/documentation/dev/index.md) - The development environment is typically deployed to a remote server and is used as sandbox.
