The SDK provides a set of tools to help manage various parts of the DigitalState architecture, from setting a local development environment to running test suites and deploying to remote servers.

It is the central repository used by developers.

## Synopsis

1. **Install** the requirements (Docker).
1. **Download** the SDK repository to your local machine.
1. **Boot** the SDK container and **enter** the console.
1. **Execute** pre-built commands to help with various tasks.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to install Docker (for [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) / for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac)). The SDK uses Docker to run a local container and execute [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) commands for its orchestration.

Download this repository.

Open a console window and make it point to the root of the repository directory:

```
cd /home/workspace/sdk
```

Boot the container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Confirm the container has been booted successfully:

```
docker ps
```

Enter the container in console mode:

```
docker exec -it ds_sdk /bin/sh
```

At this point, we have the SDK container running and ready to accept commands.

## Documentation

The SDK contains various pre-built commands, implemented as Ansible playbooks [here](resource/orchestration/index.md), to help with development, testing and deployment.
